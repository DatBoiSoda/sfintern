As a part of the Salesforce internship, we conducted market research and discovered business opportunties/gaps for 20+ whitespace clients for Salesforceâ€™s account executives.

Subsequently, we were tasked to built Tableau dashboards for Sales Demo for the clients we researched. This would help whitespace clients gauge how Tableau can help their business better.

For this occassion, I built a logistic dashboard for F&P Healthcare, which is a large medical equipment manufacturer and showed how a logistic dashboard can help streamline their operations
